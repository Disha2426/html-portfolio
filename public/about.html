<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Disha Lalwani — a developer with a creative heart and a mind wired for clean logic and purposeful design. I believe great digital experiences lie at the intersection of function and feeling — and I love crafting them from the ground up.</p>

<p>My journey is rooted in curiosity and shaped by a passion for building intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that not only work flawlessly but feel right. Whether it's front-end design that tells a visual story or back-end logic that powers it all, I enjoy writing code that’s thoughtful, efficient, and impactful.</p>

<p>Beyond the screen, I’m driven by a love for problem-solving, learning new things, and creating work that connects. I thrive on turning ideas — whether mine or yours — into digital realities that are meaningful, polished, and built to last.</p>
